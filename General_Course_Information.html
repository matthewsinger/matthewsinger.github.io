Introduction to Class-based Program Design&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Assignments.html" title="forward to &quot;Assignments&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div><h3><a name="(part._.General_.Course_.Information)"></a>General Course Information</h3><h4><a name="(part._.Classroom_.Participation)"></a>Classroom Participation</h4><p>There are two essential components to this course: the classroom, and the assignments.
The classroom provides us an opportunity to explore new topics and ideas together,
generate discussion, and learn from each other. As such, classroom participation is
very much encouraged, and lectures will be structured in a Q&amp;A style (with questions
coming from both directions!).</p><p>As such, please ask the questions you have and don&rsquo;t be afraid to give answers
you aren&rsquo;t totally sure of. If you&rsquo;re unsure of a topic, the likelihood is
incredibly high so is one of your classmates, so speaking up will not just
help you, but also your peers. Also, incorrect answers can be more instructive
than correct ones, and often lead to great discussions! So long as you
are being thoughtful and respectful to everyone in class,
you cannot go wrong participating.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Laptops_in_.Class)"></a>Laptops in Class</h4><p>This may come as a surprise given this is a computer science course,
but laptops (and other digital devices, unless otherwise specified by an
accommodation) are not allowed in class. Lecture code will be posted to Google Classroom
after class.</p><p>The purpose of class is to learn how to think about programming; it is very hard to think
and copy down code at the same time (try out <a href="http://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2017/7/28-1">the
demonstration</a> here on the costs of task switching, which is commonly called multitasking).
As far as learning syntax, there will be plenty of examples to refer to from lecture code.
Also, given that you are a student in CS2, you already know that the underlying concepts of programming
are much more essential than the syntax by which they are represented, and that repeated programming
(via assignments) is the best way to learn and internalize syntax.</p><p>The exception to the laptop policy is for when we will install Eclipse together on the second day of class,
as outlined directly below.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Programming_.Environment)"></a>Programming Environment</h4><p>The IDE (integrated development environment) installed on the school
computers and the one you should use is the Eclipse IDE. The second
day of class will be dedicated to ensuring the installation and proper functioning of Eclipse
on your laptops. Note that we use a specific version of Java to support our libraries,
so you should wait to install Java and Eclipse until class. If you do not have
a laptop, you should look on with a peer while we install Eclipse,
and detailed instructions will be given for at-home installation.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Communications)"></a>Communications</h4><p>I can be reached at my school email, and should generally respond within 24 hours (or on Monday if sent Friday-Sunday).
My office is in 3-04, and I will usually be there if not in class, or in the computer lab (2B).
Official lab periods are Tuesdays periods 5 and 7, Wednesdays period 3, Thursdays period 7, and Fridays period 1;
if you have a free period, feel free to drop by.</p><p>If you are sick or know of an upcoming abscence or conflict with an assignment, you should contact me ASAP to work
out the details. As far as help with homeworks, see the lab policy below.</p><h4><a name="(part._.The_.Dangers_of_.Copy_.Pasting)"></a>The Dangers of Copy/Pasting</h4><p>There are two kinds of harmful copy/pasting. The first is copying part of your own code
to other parts of your code, as this a sign you should likely be abstracting instead of duplicating
your code. The second, much more serious kind, is copying someone else&rsquo;s code into your own; in this course,
that is considered cheating.</p><p>Cheating in CS2 is a high risk/low reward activity. It is low reward because we have many assignments,
and one partially completed or incompleted assignment will not tank your grade. It is high risk because
there is a very small student population, so I will have a very good idea as to what your code usually looks like.
If you copy from the internet, I will be able to tell it isn&rsquo;t yours, and worse, if you copy from your peer,
I will be able to tell who you copied it from.</p><p>Cheating is also low reward because not completing an assignment is a sign that you don&rsquo;t grasp the material,
are struggling with your workload, or both. In any of these cases, talking to myself and/or your advisor
as soon as possible is by far the most productive step you can take. Be proactive about your education;
make decisions that will most greatly impact your longterm understanding instead of taking
shortcuts. This is one of the best things you can do for yourself as not only a student, but a person,
and learning these habits now is one of the best ways to prepare yourself for life after Commonwealth.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Peer-to-.Peer_.Collaboration)"></a>Peer-to-Peer Collaboration</h4><p>While copy/pasting from your classmates is forbidden, they can be very helpful in the learning process.
Discussing course concepts and assignments at a high level is both fruitful and encouraged,
and if I am not available, your peers are your best allies in becoming developed programmers.
As a general rule of thumb, if you&rsquo;re collaborating together on a whiteboard and not spelling out
answers directly, you are likely not committing any academic integrity violations.</p><h4><a name="(part._gen-assgn)"></a>Assignments</h4><p>As per the Student Bill of Rights, while homeworks will be posted here, they will be linked to from Google
Classroom. Assignment submissions should consist of one .java file, or as our programs become larger,
one .zip file containing .java files. Assignments should reflect the code quality as demonstrated
in class, especially in regards to clarity, documentation, and test coverage.</p><p>As per school policy, assignments should take 45-60 minutes. If an assignment is posted multiple
classes out (such as for complex games), no other assignments will be given in the interim to allow for the time
required to complete it. Practice-oriented assignments will usually be assigned Monday and due Wednesday,
and more intricate assignments will usually be assigned Wednesday and due Monday.</p><p>Feedback will be given via Google Classroom in (what I hope will be) a regular schedule with a fairly quick
turnaround, to be organically discovered early during the school year. Feedback will consist of a letter grade
and a comment pertaining to the strengths of the submission and areas needing improvement, possibly with references
to specific lines of code.</p><p>Late assignments will be penalized at a half letter grade for one day, a whole letter grade for two, and not accepted after that.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Labs_policy)"></a>Labs policy</h4><p>Lab periods are an excellent opportunity to work on homework, ask clarifying questions, and recieve help debugging.
There are usually two sources of questions from student programmers, one being understanding the task at hand,
and the other having to do with their specific implementation of it.</p><p>If you have questions about the content
of the assignment, be sure you&rsquo;ve read the entire assignment first, as your question may be answered later.
A good technique for understanding technical writing, much like dense prose, is to slow down your pace, and
possibly read it aloud to yourself. Be sure to try both of these approaches before asking clarifying questions,
as answering your own questions will better enable you to do so in the future.</p><p>If you find yourself stuck when programming, taking time to formulate your question is an incredibly productive step.
Think carefully about what you&rsquo;ve done (what classes have/haven&rsquo;t you designed, what methods have/haven&rsquo;t
you defined, etc.) and how to articulate it, so the person helping you can quickly understand where your question is coming from
and help you as best as possible. If this seems daunting, don&rsquo;t worry; you will become better at this with practice.</p><p>As with groking the assignment, an essential step in debugging or progressing in writing code when you&rsquo;re stuck is to
first try and un-stuck yourself. A skill all programmers must learn is balancing the tension between answering the question
on your own, and not wasting too much time on a problem you cannot solve. Never give up immediately, but 5 minutes spent totally
stuck is a sign it&rsquo;s time to step away and come back to a problem later, or ask for help.</p><h4><a name="(part._.The_.A.P_.Exam)"></a>The AP Exam</h4><p>As stated elsewhere on the site, this course will prepare you for the AP Computer Science A exam. While the course is not geared
towards the exam, students at Commonwealth have the distinct advantage of taking two years of programming before taking the exam,
which is not usually the case. As test-time approaches, we will ensure you can map the skills covered in this class onto the exam,
largely through practice testing. Note that the order this course goes in differs wildly from most AP courses, so I recommend
talking to me before trying out practice tests early if you are so inclined, as you may find yourself misguidedly discouraged
by the material you can&rsquo;t yet answer.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Grades)"></a>Grades</h4><p>Grades will be calculated based on class participation, assignment grades, and projects (which are effectively just large
assignments). Some assignments will be weighted more highly
than others. As the year progresses, if further transparency is required, we can begin to define this more exactly.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="backward to &quot;Commonwealth School CS2
